# Text Sticker Selection Project

This project aims to provide a tool for designers to select appropriate text stickers based on a set of image captions. By interacting with the OpenAI GPT-3 API, it generates a theme and selects stickers that align with the generated theme. The primary function utilized for this task is `caption_stickering`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `openai` library installed
- OpenAI API key set as environment variable

```bash
pip install openai
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Text-Sticker-Selection.git
cd Text-Sticker-Selection
```

## Usage

Import the `caption_stickering` function from the provided script and use it as follows:

```python
from text_sticker_selection import caption_stickering

# Define the stickers and spread captions
stickers = ['Happy Birthday!', 'Best Wishes', 'Congratulations!', ...]
spread_captions = [['A cat chasing a ball', 'A dog barking at a tree'], 
                   ['A family having a picnic', 'Kids playing in the park']]

# Call the function
response = caption_stickering(stickers, spread_captions, report_cost=True)
print(response)
```

## Function Documentation

```python

Function Description:
    The `caption_stickering` function interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate a theme and 
    select appropriate text stickers based on a set of image captions. 
    It constructs a conversation for GPT-3, makes an API call to GPT-3, and returns the generated response.

Inputs:
    1. stickers (list of str):
        - A list of available text stickers.

    2. spread_captions (list of list of str):
        - A list where each sub-list contains captions describing a set of images in a spread.

    3. model (str, optional, default="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"):
        - The variant of the GPT-3 model to be used for generating the response.

    4. report_cost (bool, optional, default=False):
        - A flag indicating whether to report the token usage and cost of the API call.

Outputs:
    - model_response (str):
        - The response generated by GPT-3 based on the input conversation.
